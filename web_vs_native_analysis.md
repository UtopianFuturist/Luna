# React Native vs Web Build Analysis

## Key Findings:

### 1. **App.native.tsx is React Native Code**
- Contains React Native specific imports (react-native-gesture-handler, expo-*, etc.)
- Uses `#/` path aliases that are React Native/Expo specific
- Should NOT be used as web page.tsx

### 2. **Original page.tsx Found**
- Located at `/home/ubuntu/OmniSky/page.tsx`
- Contains web-compatible React code
- Uses `@/` aliases (compatible with Next.js)
- References AppLayout component

### 3. **Path Alias Issues**
- `#/` aliases used in App.native.tsx are React Native/Expo specific
- Not defined in tsconfig.json (only `@/` is defined)
- These should not be used in web build

### 4. **Correct Web Entry Point**
- Use the existing `page.tsx` file as `src/app/page.tsx`
- This file properly uses AppLayout and web-compatible imports
- Already has proper `@/` path aliases

## Solution:
1. Use original page.tsx as the web entry point
2. Keep App.native.tsx separate for React Native builds
3. Ensure all web components use `@/` aliases, not `#/`
