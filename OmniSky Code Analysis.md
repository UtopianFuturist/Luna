# OmniSky Code Analysis

## Authentication and Routing Analysis

### Key Files Examined:
1. **AuthContext.tsx** - Manages authentication state and provides login/logout functionality
2. **SignInFlow.tsx** - Implements the sign-in flow UI and logic
3. **ProtectedRoute.tsx** - Handles route protection and redirection based on auth state
4. **src/app/signin/page.tsx** - Next.js app router page for the sign-in route
5. **src/app/layout.tsx** - Root layout that wraps the application
6. **agent.ts** - API client for BlueSky authentication

### Authentication Flow:
1. User navigates to `/signin`
2. The SignInFlow component is rendered with three steps:
   - Welcome screen
   - Credentials screen
   - Two-factor authentication screen (if needed)
3. On successful login, the user should be redirected to the home page (`/`)

### Potential Issues:

#### 1. Import Path Issues
- In `src/app/signin/page.tsx`, the import path for SignInFlow is using a relative path:
  ```tsx
  import SignInFlow from '../../../SignInFlow';
  ```
  This might be incorrect if the file structure has changed.

#### 2. Authentication Context Issues
- The AuthContext is being used in the SignInFlow component, but there might be issues with how it's being provided or consumed.
- The error handling in the authentication flow might not be properly catching or displaying errors.

#### 3. Routing Issues
- In SignInFlow.tsx, after successful login, the code uses `router.push('/')` to redirect to the home page.
- This might be failing if there are issues with the Next.js router configuration.

#### 4. Protected Route Implementation
- The ProtectedRoute component is checking authentication state and redirecting users, but there might be issues with how it's determining the current route or handling redirects.

#### 5. Client-Side vs. Server-Side Rendering
- Next.js uses a hybrid rendering approach, and there might be issues with how the authentication state is being handled between client and server components.
- The "use client" directive is present in the components, but there might be issues with how state is being managed.

### Console Errors Observed:
- 404 errors for some resources
- Login error: "Invalid identifier or password"
- Error in the authentication flow: "Failed to login (outer catch): Error: Invalid identifier or password"
